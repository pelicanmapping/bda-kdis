Hi,

Thanks for downloading KDIS.

NOTE: KDIS has now been tested on Linux,Windows and Mac OSX Leopard however if you do have any problems please let me know.

The KDIS website including a users guide can be found at:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
This explains how to use the CMakeLists.txt file to quickly set up KDIS for your chosen IDE as well as details on the various examples.

Full class documentation can be found:-
online: http://kdis.sourceforge.net/classdoc/

Note: From KDIS Version 2.1.0 a new cross-platform socket class exists called 'Connection', this class replaces the old windows only KSockets class.
